# Craft CMS Generator
> Starterkit for Craft CMS (Mutli Envs, Gulp, Bower and SASS/SCSS with Sourcemaps)

## Installation
First, install [Craft CLI](https://github.com/rsanchez/craft-cli) for installing Craft CMS trough your command line (it’s used by the generator).

```bash
brew tap rsanchez/homebrew-craft-cli
brew install craft-cli
```

Second, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-craftskeleton using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-craftskeleton
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo craftskeleton
```
